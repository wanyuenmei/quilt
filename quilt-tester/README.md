# Quilt Continuous Integration

`quilt-tester` runs `quilt` using the official `quilt/quilt` Docker image and
ssh's into each of the servers and runs a test script.
If the output of the test script contains "FAILED", then `quilt-tester` interprets
this test as having failed.

## Setup
[setup](vagrant/setup) should take care of everything.

For local instances:
```
cd vagrant
vagrant up && vagrant ssh
sudo ./setup # do this inside the VM
```

Make sure that if you're testing a fork of the project, that `quilt-tester`
is included as a user.

On AWS, just scp the setup file over and do the same thing.

The script will ask you a couple questions to configure itself.

The IP address is used to generate links to test results.

The slack channel is used to determine where to post results. You can
use `@$USER` (e.g. @kklin) to get the results DMd.

The "aws credentials cron" is a cron job that updates the aws credentials file
every night. Only use this if you're on AWS, and IAM roles are properly setup
for the host.

The `Vagrantfile` tries to copy your aws credentials over automatically from
the host computer, so other than answering the initial questions, you shouldn't
have to setup anything else.

## Usage
You can trigger a new test run by sending a GET or POST request to
`http://$IP/cgi-bin/trigger_run`.

## Adding tests
Tests are written in Go and cross-compiled into an executable with the command

```bash
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build <TEST_NAME>.go
```

To add a test, place it in the [tests](tests) directory. Each folder represents
a *test suite*, which contains a spec (with the same name as the folder) and
tests to run on that specific spec. For example, [tests/spark](tests/spark) runs
`spark.spec` and checks that the Spark job approximated pi. Print `"PASSED"` if
a test passes, and `"FAILED"` if a test fails. If you would like output from
commands to be saved, make sure you print them (See the [os/exec](https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/)
library for more. If you want to run the test on the master machine only, append `_monly` to the
name of your test file.

## Logging
When things break, you can take a look at the `quilt-tester` log. Each run
saves logs to `/var/www/quilt-tester/$RUN/logs`.

A quick way to watch the logs is
`tail -f "$(\ls -1dt /var/www/quilt-tester/*/ | head -n 1)/logs/quilt-tester.log"`

## Security
`~/.ssh` must contain a private key associated with a GitHub account for the
Quilt repo. The associated public key must be in the spec file. A default key
and spec is provided in the repo.

Additionally, aws credentials must be present in `~/.aws`

## Apache
Apache needs to be configured to serve up `$WEB_ROOT` as defined in [tester](bin/tester).
The `setup` script should handle all the details.

## Modifying the testing interval
By default, the tests are automatically run every hour. You can tweak
`quilt-tester`'s crontab (using `crontab -e` as `quilt-tester`) to change the
time interval.

## Updating the Tester
When you update `quilt-tester.go`, make sure to cross-compile it (just like you
would with a test file) and place it in `bin/`.

## XXX:
- Setup post-commit hooks on Github for updating the tests folder and testing
  new merges
- Package quilt-controller, quilt-minion, and quilt-tester as containers for
  easy deployment
- Make sure we clean up after each test
    - Kill the minions using `aws cli` if the controller hangs
    - Bail early if things fail in the script
    - Assume failure if the minions don't connect after a certain timeout
- Ping kklin on slack if the tester seems to be failing (e.g. if we're timing
  out)
- Differentiate tests for master and workers?
- Create summary of names of tests that failed
- Do a security audit
- Allow only one instance of `quilt-tester` to run per machine at a time
- Remove the `quilt-tester` ssh key
